# Changes Made to Implement Fleet-Level Replacement Strategies

## Overview
The codebase has been modified to recommend fleet-level replacements rather than individual device replacements, which is more practical for medical facilities. This document outlines the key changes made to implement this strategy.

## New Functions Added

### 1. `calculate_fleet_scores`
- Groups devices by their type (creating fleets)
- Calculates fleet-level metrics:
  - Average age of the fleet
  - Average maintenance costs
  - Highest risk level in the fleet (using the most critical device)
  - Average maintenance history score
  - Highest location score (using the most critical location)
  - Utilization rate specific to the device type
- Assigns a total score to each fleet based on these metrics
- Calculates the total replacement cost for the entire fleet

### 2. `generate_fleet_forecast`
- Prioritizes fleets based on their total score
- For each year in the forecast:
  - Attempts to replace entire fleets when budget allows
  - For high-priority fleets (score > 75), recommends partial replacements when full replacement isn't possible
  - For partial replacements, selects the oldest devices in the fleet (20% of the fleet size)
  - Tracks both complete and partial fleet replacements

### 3. `output_fleet_forecast`
- Clearly indicates whether a replacement is complete or partial
- Shows the number of devices being replaced in each fleet
- Provides cost information at the fleet level
- Maintains the annual budget tracking

## Configuration Changes

Added a new parameter to the config file:
- `HIGH_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD`: Set to 75, this determines when a fleet should be considered for partial replacement if a full replacement isn't possible within the budget.

## Main Function Changes

Modified the `main()` function to:
- Use the new fleet-level scoring and forecasting functions
- Output fleet-level replacement recommendations

## Benefits of Fleet-Level Replacement Strategy

1. **Strategic Planning**: Facilities can now plan replacements at the fleet level, which is more practical for budgeting and operations.

2. **Partial Replacement Option**: For high-priority fleets that can't be fully replaced due to budget constraints, the system recommends replacing the oldest 20% of devices, allowing for phased replacement.

3. **Risk Management**: By considering the highest risk level in a fleet, the system ensures that critical devices are prioritized.

4. **Cost Efficiency**: Replacing entire fleets can often be more cost-effective than individual replacements due to potential volume discounts and reduced administrative overhead.

5. **Operational Continuity**: Fleet-level replacements allow for better planning of downtime and training.

## Additional Changes: Budget and Non-Budget Scenarios

### 1. Flexible Budget Handling
- Modified the system to handle both budget-constrained and unconstrained scenarios
- Added command-line argument `--budget` to optionally specify an annual budget
- When no budget is provided, the system generates recommendations based on device scores and age

### 2. New Function: `generate_unconstrained_forecast`
- Creates replacement recommendations based on device scores and age when no budget is provided
- Calculates optimal replacement timing for each fleet using:
  - Device age relative to expected lifecycle (primary factor)
  - Device score (secondary factor that can override age-based recommendations)
- For devices past their expected lifecycle:
  - If score is low (good performance), extends replacement timeline by 3-5 years
  - If score is moderate, extends replacement timeline by 1-2 years
  - If score is high (poor performance), recommends immediate replacement
- For devices approaching end-of-life:
  - If score is low, extends replacement timeline
  - If score is high, recommends replacement at expected end-of-life
- For newer devices, recommends replacement based on expected lifecycle
- Includes all devices in the forecast, even those with replacement years beyond 10 years
- Groups devices with replacement years beyond 10 years into a special "Beyond 10 Years" category

### 3. Enhanced Output
- Updated output to clearly indicate whether recommendations are budget-constrained or unconstrained
- For unconstrained forecasts, shows:
  - When each fleet should be replaced based on expected lifecycle and score
  - The expected lifecycle of each device type
  - The current age of each fleet
  - The device score and how it affects the replacement timeline
  - The years until replacement for each fleet
  - A special section for fleets scheduled for replacement beyond 10 years
- For budget-constrained forecasts, shows how the budget is allocated across fleets within the 5-year window

### 4. Command-Line Interface
- Added argument parsing to allow users to specify an optional budget
- Example usage: `python main.py --budget 200000` for budget-constrained forecast
- Example usage: `python main.py` for unconstrained forecast based on scores and age

### 5. Benefits of the Revised Approach

1. **Balanced Decision Making**: The unconstrained forecast considers both device age and performance, not just blindly replacing old devices.

2. **Performance-Based Extensions**: Devices that are past their expected lifecycle but performing well have their replacement timeline extended.

3. **Long-Term Strategic Planning**: Facilities receive a comprehensive long-term replacement plan that aligns with both device lifecycles and performance.

4. **Cost Optimization**: By extending the life of well-performing devices, even if they're older, the system helps optimize long-term costs.

5. **Complete Inventory Visibility**: All devices are included in the forecast, even those with replacement years beyond 10 years, providing a complete picture of the facility's equipment.

## Additional Feature: CSV Export

### 1. New Function: `export_forecast_to_csv`
- Exports the forecast data to a CSV file for easier analysis and sharing
- Flattens the nested forecast data into a tabular format suitable for CSV
- Includes all relevant information including year, device type, fleet size, replacement type, costs, and forecast type
- For unconstrained forecasts, also includes additional metrics like score, average age, expected lifecycle, and years until replacement
- Includes a special "Beyond 10 Years" category for devices scheduled for replacement beyond the 10-year horizon
- Generates a timestamped filename to avoid overwriting previous exports
- Returns the path to the exported CSV file

### 2. Main Function Update
- Modified the `main()` function to call the new export function after generating and displaying the forecast
- Prints a confirmation message with the path to the exported CSV file

### 3. Benefits of CSV Export

1. **Data Portability**: The forecast data can be easily imported into spreadsheet software or other analysis tools.

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: The CSV includes all the key metrics needed for further analysis or reporting.

3. **Sharing and Collaboration**: The CSV file can be easily shared with stakeholders who may not have access to the application.

4. **Historical Record**: The timestamped filenames allow for tracking changes in forecasts over time.

## Very Old Device Handling (2024-03-21)

### Overview
Added functionality to identify and handle very old devices as one-off replacements, separate from their fleet. This ensures that individual devices that are significantly older than their fleet average are evaluated independently and can be replaced on their own timeline.

### Key Changes
1. **Very Old Device Identification**
   - Added `identify_very_old_devices` function to identify devices that are:
     - 50% older than their fleet average
     - At least 80% of their expected lifecycle
   - These devices are evaluated individually rather than as part of their fleet

2. **Individual Device Scoring**
   - Very old devices are scored using the same criteria as fleets but at the individual level
   - Score considers:
     - Age relative to expected lifecycle
     - Maintenance costs
     - Risk score
     - Maintenance history
     - Location score
     - Utilization (assumed high for critical devices)

3. **Replacement Strategy**
   - For budget-constrained forecasts:
     - Very old devices with high scores are prioritized for immediate replacement
     - They are handled before fleet replacements to ensure critical individual devices are addressed
   - For unconstrained forecasts:
     - Replacement timing is based on the device's score
     - Good performing devices (score < 30) may have replacement extended by 1-2 years
     - Moderate performing devices (score < 50) may have replacement extended by 1 year
     - Poor performing devices are recommended for immediate replacement

4. **Output Format**
   - Very old devices are displayed separately from fleet replacements
   - For each very old device, the output shows:
     - Device ID and type
     - Location and risk class
     - Age and fleet average age
     - Replacement cost
     - Score
     - Years until replacement
   - Devices beyond 10 years are grouped in a special section

5. **CSV Export**
   - Added new columns to track very old devices:
     - DeviceID
     - Age
     - FleetAvgAge
     - Location
     - RiskClass
     - IsVeryOldDevice flag
   - Separate entries for very old devices beyond 10 years

### Benefits
- **Improved Risk Management**: Identifies and addresses individual devices that pose higher risks due to age
- **More Granular Planning**: Allows for targeted replacement of problematic devices without waiting for fleet replacement
- **Better Resource Allocation**: Prioritizes replacement of critical individual devices within budget constraints
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Provides clear information about very old devices in reports and exports
- **Comprehensive Forecasting**: Ensures all devices are included in the forecast, with appropriate handling for very old devices

### Technical Details
- Modified `generate_fleet_forecast` to identify and handle very old devices
- Updated `generate_unconstrained_forecast` to include very old devices in the forecast
- Enhanced `output_fleet_forecast` to display very old device information
- Updated `export_forecast_to_csv` to include very old device data in exports
- Added `identify_very_old_devices` function to calculate device-specific metrics
